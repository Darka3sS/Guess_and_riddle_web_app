This project has been developed by personal purposes.

It consists of an interactive web application with a mini game, that records the results of any game played of "guess the riddle" during the session.
Before starting the game, the user has to enter a name, even fake if he wish. The user is warned about the store of the 
user name in a database for 90 days, after that is deleted. The web page also recommend to not provide personal information.

The web application system is based on a three-tier architecture (Frontend, Backend and Database). 

🖥️ The frontend is based on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, using React as a framework during the development (.JSX files).

⚙️ The backend is based on a REST API flask written in python and provides all the necessary routines under the endpoints for the game and the registration of the users and their games.

💾 The database used is Postgres and it contains a single table with id, username, date of the game, games played and games won.
